Using of PyCaret in Gcolab.

PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that exponentially speeds up the experiment cycle and makes you more productive.

Compared with the other open-source machine learning libraries, PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with a few lines only. This makes experiments exponentially fast and efficient. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks, such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, Ray, and a few more.

PyCaret’s Classification Module is a supervised machine learning module that is used for classifying elements into groups. The goal is to predict the categorical class labels which are discrete and unordered.

Some common use cases include predicting customer default (Yes or No), predicting customer churn (customer will leave or stay), the disease found (positive or negative).

This module can be used for binary or multiclass problems. It provides several pre-processing features that prepare the data for modeling through the setup function. It has over 18 ready-to-use algorithms and several plots to analyze the performance of trained models.

A typical workflow in PyCaret consist of following 5 steps in this order:

## **Setup** ➡️ **Compare Models** ➡️ **Analyze Model** ➡️ **Prediction** ➡️ **Save Model**

extra for R:

The nlme (nonlinear mixed effects) package is a popular R package for fitting and analyzing mixed-effects models. It is commonly used in biostatistics and other fields where data with both fixed and random effects need to be analyzed.

The nlme package allows for the estimation of both fixed and random effects, and provides a range of tools and functionality for model fitting, evaluation, and prediction. It also offers support for a variety of model structures, including linear, nonlinear, and generalized linear mixed models.

In summary, the nlme package is a powerful tool for fitting and analyzing mixed-effects models in R. It provides a range of features and functionality for estimating fixed and random effects, and is widely used in biostatistics and other fields where data with complex structures need to be analyzed.
