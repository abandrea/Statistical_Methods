# Some initial data exploration.

Load our libs.
```{r}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```
## Let's load the dataset!
```{r}
ds_path <- "../HealthCareAustralia.rda"
load(ds_path)
summary(ex3.health)
```

## Before doing anything concrete, let's make sure to deal with NaN's!!!

```{r}
sum(is.nan(as.matrix(ex3.health)))
```
Yo there's no NaN values, lets go!

## Some basic data exploration
Since the variable we're interested in is *doctorco*, lets measure it's
correlation with other variables.
```{r}
correlations <- cor(ex3.health[ , colnames(ex3.health) != "doctorco"],
                    ex3.health$doctorco)
levelplot(correlations)
```
