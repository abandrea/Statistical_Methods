## About the project

In this final project for the course "344SM - Statistical Methods" we were assigned a dataset concerning australian health survey from 1977 to 1978. The dataset contains information of 5190 individuals and 19 variables, including the response variable `doctorco`, which is the number of doctor consulations with a doctor or specialist in the past 2 weeks. 

For the purpose of this project, after the initial Explanatory Data Analysis, which includes a data-cleaning and data visualization, we will focus on the prediction of the number of consulations with a doctor or specialist in the past 2 weeks. We will use different statistical models and some of machine learning techniques, such as:

* Negative Binomial Regression
* Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression (ZIPB)
* Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB)
* Hurdle Poisson Regression
* Hurdle Negative binomial Regression
* Logistic Regression 
* Random Forest
* Naive Bayes
* Neural Networks
* K-Nearest Neighbors
